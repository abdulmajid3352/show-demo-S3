## Kubernetes Version Compatibility

The daemon image contains a 1.28.x k8s.io/{client-go,kubectl} for the purposes of maintaining the lock and draining worker nodes. Kubernetes aims to provide forwards & backwards compatibility of one minor version between client and server, so this should work on 1.27.x, 1.28.x and 1.29.x

Thanks a lot to everyone who contributed to kured since 1.15.0.

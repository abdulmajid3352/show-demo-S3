## :warning:  Important notice

Due to the changes made for the new `signal` reboot-mode to reduce needed permissions of kured, the default
sentinel path and its mounting have changed. If you are using our YAML-Manifests instead of the helm-chart
please ensure to update the full manifest instead of only increasing the version-number.
There are two manifest-variants in the repo available now: `kured-ds.yaml` with the "old" reboot-command mechanism and the new
`kured-ds-signal.yaml` manifest which uses the new reboot-signal mechanism with non-privileged permissions.

## Kubernetes Version Compatibility

The daemon image contains a 1.28.x k8s.io/{client-go,kubectl} for the purposes of maintaining the lock and draining worker nodes. Kubernetes aims to provide forwards & backwards compatibility of one minor version between client and server, so this should work on 1.27.x, 1.28.x and 1.29.x

Thanks a lot to everyone who contributed to kured since 1.14.2.
